# Logger
A python logger that creates log files for personal use or industrial use such as games crashes or attendance.
# Logger Commands:
Do not add the <>. They are used to tell that is supposed to be of your choice.
Use quotation marks around the <> unless you are inputing a string variable
check the functions for commands if they are changed.
the text after the double backslash gives the definiton of the command
createlog(<logname>) //Creates a log
editlog(<logname>) // adds data to a log
readlog(<logname>) // prints the log
writelog(<logname>) // rewrites the log after removing all previous data
deletelog(<logname>) // deletes the log file
ls() // lists all logs made and deleted with their date

# For the idiots: 
download the file and put it into the directory of your choice.
To access a command, type "from logger import <command-name>" if the file is in a subdirectory or in the same directory.
To access it in command line, go to your CLI and go to the directory of the file using the "cd" command. Type "python logger.py".
Give the file a folder if you will be accesing it using a idle to stop file clutter.
